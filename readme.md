# Inventory System

To learn more about C++'s vectors (lists). I decided to make an inventory system in C++. 

This is capable of adding items to your inventory and using them. Items can have infinite uses or a limited amount.  
Currently the items are hardcoded, but the bare functionality for loading them in via external sources is implemented.
